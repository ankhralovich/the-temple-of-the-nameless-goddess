# The Temple of The Nameless Goddess

## Requirements
A script that tests a game "The Temple of The Nameless Goddess" based on d6 rolls.

This week you are asked to make a simple game on a single sheet of paper. Your game should include:

1. A clearly articulated goal, and
2. A degree of difficulty enhanced by chance and/or skill.

Additionally, you must keep the following limitations in mind:

1. The game should all fit on one piece of paper, ideally letter-sized or A4 so people can print it out, if they wish.
2. The game should be a one-player game.
3. A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page.
4. The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice, which are an optional element you may include in your game.


## The Rules

**The plot:** Deep in the forest of Sarkash, there is a forgotten temple of the Nameless Goddess, even the elders don't remember who she was and how she fell. Under the temple, in a ruined crypt, lies The Book of Ancient Whispers that unfolds eldritch secrets to the one who dares reach them.

**The goal:** get the artifact placed in the Main Crypt Chamber before the enemies get you. Good luck!

**Prereqisites:** a pen, a piece of paper,  2d6 dice.

**Background music:** GNOLL -- Black Terra

**The rules:**

1. Take a piece of paper and a pen. Roll 2d6 and sum up the result to determine your starting equipment (you can have max two items, reroll if you got the same item twice):

**Table 1. Equipment**

| 2d6   | Equipment                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| 2-3   | A healing potion (restores 1d6+1 HP). |
| 4-5   | A club (1d6 point of damage).         |
| 6     | A sword (1d6+1 points of damage).     |
| 7     | Leather armor (-2 to dmg).            |
| 8-9   | Nothing. What a pity!                 |
| 10-12 | A shield (-1 to dmg).                 |
2. Roll 2d6 to identify your HP pool. Sum up the two numbers you've got.
3. You are all set for the adventure! Roll 2d6 to determine the type of the first room using the table below and follow instructions from the "Action" section. Repeat until ~~you die~~ the Book is obtained!

**Table 2. Chamber type**

| 2d6     | Chamber type         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 or 12 | Main Crypt Chamber   | You see a big room, moss on the walls, heavy air, and an ancient altar at the center.  It is dark, but you can guess the book lays on the altar, among dust, scattered chalices and candles that extinguished long ago. Come get your book, you lucky bastard! And get out of here. |
| 3-4     | Reliquary Chambers   | You enter a small cluttered room that still retains a strong scent of incense. Holy relics once revered are now forgotten. Roll 2d6 on the "Treasure" table.                                                                                                                        |
| 5-6     | Sacristy             | You see a tiny room with not proportionally big oval wash basin and a tiny window. The cabinets are full of vestments and bottles of unused oil. Roll 2d6 on the "Random event" table.                                                                                              |
| 7-8     | Columbarium          | A long, narrow, dark hall, each wall has a shelf with urns, dusty and scattered. There are also remains of broken urns under you feet. Roll 2d6 on the "Random encounter" table. Let the fun begin!                                                                                 |
| 9-11    | Tombs and Sarcophagi | You see rows of sealed stone coffins. Something moves in the shadows â€” not alive, but not quite at peace either. Roll 2d6 on the "Random encounter" table.                                                                                                                          |

4. If you rolled an encounter, roll 1d6 for your initiative, and then 1d6 for the enemy. The highest number wins the initiative and starts the combat. You roll for attack and damage both for you and the enemy. Attack roll defines whether you hit or miss, and damage roll defines the damage. Use the "Attack roll" table to define hit or miss, and use stats of your weapon to define damage. 
5. As an action, you can attack or heal. If you heal yourself, you can't attack during this turn. 
6. If no weapon, use unarmored strike (1, no need to roll here, if you hit with a glancing blow, you also deal 0,5 damage. Better than nothing!)
7. 0 HP = death.

**Table 3. Attack roll

| 2d6  | Attack outcome               |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| <=6  | Miss                         |
| 7-9  | Glancing blow (half damage)  |
| >=10 | Hit (full damage)            |
| 12   | Critical hit (double damage) |


**Table 4. Random encounter**

| 2d6   | Enemy                          | Damage  | HP  |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------- | --- |
| 2, 12 | No enemy. it was just a shadow | -       | -   |
| 3-5   | Big hungry rat                 | 1d6/2   | 1   |
| 6-8   | Shaky skeleton                 | 1d6/2   | 2   |
| 9-11  | Rotten zombie                  | 1d6/2+1 | 3   |


**Table 5. Random event -- traps or a prize

| 2d6  | Event                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2    | Spike Pit. You expect another chamber, but instead there is a dark shaft full of venom spikes. Distract -5 HP. Ouch!                                                                             |
| 3-5  | You see a beautiful icon of a Goddess in a heavy frame. You decide to pray, and your request has been heard: heal +1 HP if your HP pool is not max.                                              |
| 6-8  | Nothing to do here.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 9-11 | As you enter the chamber, you feel sticky web on your face. Distracted by it, you don't see a small dart flying towards you. Distract -1HP. Someone does not like guests, but it could be worse! |
| 12   | You sense strong magical presence in this chamber. Heal +5HP if your HP pool is not max.                                                                                                         |


**Table 6. Treasure**

| 2d6  | Treasure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2    | You see a dead man in the center of this chamber. When you step in, a pack of rats runs away from the corpse. You come closer and you can't stop your reflex, you vomit. The odor is disgusting, the rats eat half of the man's face (and maybe something else, better not to know). However, the matter of your survival is more important than your principles, so you decide to loot the body. Looks like it was a brave adventure seeker, just like you. His armor is rusty and his shield is damaged, but you find a waterskin and a big mace (2d6+4 damage). |
| 3-4  | An empty room with some leftovers of food on the table. Heals 1 HP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5-6  | This chamber is quite messy and disturbing: skulls, bones, some blood-stained cloths lie among wax seals and empty reliquaries. But, something catches your eye. A beautiful bone rosary with a crucifix lays on the floor. Adds +1 to your attack roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7-8  | For a moment, you think you see an outline of a chest in the corner. You run to it, but it is just a play of lights and shadows from the window. What a pity!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 9-11 | Looks like this chamber has been abandoned a long ago, or maybe looted by someone else. The only valuable thing you could find here is an old and a little bit stinky robe. Reduces 1 point of damage while you wear it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12   | In the corner, you see a cluttered desk. You come closer, and find a bunch of old pergamins and a pile of books. You hands are shaking: maybe The Book of Whispers is here! But no, not this time. Discouraged, you open all the drawers with no hopes. The mostly contain some useless stuff, but you find a big healing potion (1d6+4) in a bottle covered with dust in the last one.                                                                                                                                                                            |
